Hello there!

This is my first ever program and I do hope you enjoyed it! A lot of fun was
had and as you can see I am a programmer of below-novice level, but I intend
on becoming a better programmer and game designer in the future.

To play the game, open the file named "three.py", preferably on PyCharm 
and running it in the program. Reason being that Command Prompt did not allow
my game to be played the same way that PyCharm runs it.

I understand that the game is nothing to boast and that it did not follow the rules
but I did learn many things about programming. I look forward to learning more.

Have Fun!!
