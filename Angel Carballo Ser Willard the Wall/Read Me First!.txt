Hello there!

This is my first ever program and I do hope you enjoyed it! A lot of fun was
had, and as you can see, I developed this when I was a programmer of below-novice level, but I have developed over the years.

To play the game, open the file named "three.py", preferably on PyCharm 
and running it in the program. Reason being that Command Prompt did not allow
my game to be played the same way that PyCharm runs it.


Have Fun!!
